        When something is gained, something is lost. It&#x27;s difficult to live
        after something like that. What is lost will never return. Important
        things, irreplaceable things. But what is needed to keep those things is
        in the firm will, packed into one bullet. Man knows... he knows that
        nothing will begin unless he speaks, and that nothing will change unless
        he moves.

        Physical wounds will definitely bleed and may look painful \r\nbut over

        bad handwriting, can&#x27;t learn, insensitive, weak, a slow runner, a

        angry, and when you fight. But they really are your precious friends. It
        doesn&#x27;t matter why you became friends, but that you are friends at
        this moment.

        understand? Not to accept it, not to face it, but he chose to avoid it.

        If I abandoned you, I would be released from this pain. I would live on.
        But before long, I would end up seeking you again, for all my actions
        are ultimately devoted to you and only you. All I want is to stay on
        target and walk straight ahead\xe2\x80\x94ignoring the losses and
        opposition, and even the results. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I can do. Some
        people might call it an obsession, others may deem it a
        miracle\xe2\x80\x94but to me and many others, my driving rationale
        couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more obvious and natural. There are people who
        understand this and there are people who don\xe2\x80\x99t, and I simply
        happen to belong to the first group. The only difference is whether they
        have noticed that they don\xe2\x80\x99t need boxes to make their wishes
        come true, and what it means to fulfill a wish. My commitment to find
        you comes with great suffering. Not once have I thought it\xe2\x80\x99s
        easy. For your sake, I laughed, cried, and yelled. Because of you, I
        destroyed my heart, my body, and the world. Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m only
        really alive when I\xe2\x80\x99m touching the fragment of you that I
        carry within me. Even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t reach you in the
        end\xe2\x80\xa6 Even if I know the horrible outcome that awaits
        me\xe2\x80\xa6 I will keep searching for you, who dwells inside Maria.
        I\xe2\x80\x99m going to vanish. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m getting my just
        deserts for being too greedy with my wish. To be honest, part of me
        regrets that we met, but if I were to choose between a life in which we
        met and a life in which we didn\xe2\x80\x99t, I would always pick the
        former. Always. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of that, even though I may be
        hesitating over, wavering about, and regretting my choices all the time.
        I will not have accomplished anything by the time I vanish, and
        I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not mature enough to say that I can accept
        that. Even now, I\xe2\x80\x99m still dreaming\xe2\x80\x94
        \xe2\x80\xa6that my efforts might be rewarded with some kind of happy
        ending.

        Even if you have regrets, even if you have remorse, you must fight. If
        you have made the decision for yourself to fight, to struggle, then
        fight with all you have. Do not give up for one second, one moment, or
        one instant. Cling greedily to the victory you have within your sight.
        If you can still stand, if your fingers still move, if all your teeth
        have not broken, stand and fight. You must fight!

        Some questions with no answers cannot be answered even by those who live
        forever. Yet, the absence of a correct answer does not mean the question
        cannot be answered. If you want to know how I felt about the complete
        ban on some culture and art that I could not understand, was not
        interested in, or could not accept, in the name of preventing the
        violations of others\xe2\x80\x99 rights or other trumped up charges, I
        believe that would be taking us onto the road of discriminating against
        others. If we define culture as that which is healthy or humane, and
        defend that decision in the name of justice, once any part of that
        system collapses, it will cause an unimaginable number of problems for
        society. For instance, if I drew a line in the middle and erased one

        life. It gets worse if the fish is replaced by an amphibian, and even
        more so if the amphibian becomes a reptile. The pressure is worse if the
        reptile becomes a bird, and even worse when the bird becomes a mammal.
        The higher up the chain we move towards the more advanced creatures, the

        bothersome NEET vampire who fought to protect a human he had just met
        too! I&#x27;ve seen a lot more than just their bad sides. They&#x27;re

        what&#x27;s bothering you too. Neither humans nor vampires need reasons
        to want to protect or save something. If they find C3 is weakening, the
        balance between humans and non-humans will collapse. If we suffer major
        damage from Tsubaki&#x27;s side and asked you all for help, can you
        guarantee that none of the other vampires would attack C3? I don&#x27;t

        while you can. The tide will bring those of unmatched power and the New
        Era will begin!

        Whats the probability of drawing the ace of spades from a deck with no
        jokers? Normaly it would be 1/50. But what if its a brand new deck? The
        position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means
        if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom,
        it&#x27;s the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that&#x27;s
        right! I didn&#x27;t say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you
        didn&#x27;t ask. Being in the &quot;no&quot; gives you the power to turn

        So take it all in, don&#x27;t even blink, Miroku. There&#x27;s no place
        like hell! We made it so. With our lust, and greed. It always comes down
        to this. Life is desire. It&#x27;s what we do. When desire meets desire,
        the stronger survives. The predator will eat the prey. It&#x27;s dirty,
        and cruel. But just look around you, there is so much beauty in this
        truth. And yet you still look away. And you waste all your time alone in
        your head. Don&#x27;t deny your desires. Hell is the real paradise. And
        we, my friend, are in paradise! Don&#x27;t look away, Miroku!

        It is impossible to not hurt someone. Humans unconsciously hurt others
        by simply existing. Whether you are alive or dead, you keep hurting
        people. Getting involved will hurt them, but trying not to get involved
        might hurt them too. But if it&#x27;s someone you don&#x27;t care about,
        you won&#x27;t notice you&#x27;ve hurt them. What&#x27;s important is
        your awareness of it. It&#x27;s because you care about them, that you
        feel like you&#x27;ve hurt them. Caring about someone means being
        resolved to the fact that you&#x27;ll hurt them. The more people care
        for each other, the farther out of reach certain things get. But
        that&#x27;s not something to be sad about, I think it&#x27;s probably
        something to be proud of.

        What is there, over there? There is nothing. I was born in a bottom of a
        pit where no light shone. As if pressed together by the darkness.
        Untouched by everything at all. Born under those dark, dark sediments. I
        had a white form. My comrades were all in pure black. In those black
        forms with their eyes shining and teeth baring they were certainly
        eating something. And then... There was nothing to me, except my eyes. I
        felt nothing. No rather... It was possible that what I felt was
        &quot;void&quot;, yet. I could hear nothing, I could bite nothing, I
        could smell nothing, I could feel nothing as I touch, I could not rest.
        I had no companion. Just walking, alone. The things reflected in my eyes
        have no meaning. The things that could not be reflected in my eyes do
        not exist. Walking walking walking walking walking walking walking
        walking. When I had arrived at last. I have found something
        extraordinary. It was somewhat the place of birth for those strange
        translucent objects that dotted this world. It was the first time... my
        eyes have been captured. With no colour, with no sound, with no scent.
        Does not interact with anything, it only exists there. It was the
        closest existence to &quot;void&quot; that I had ever laid eyes on. I
        sank my body... into... that great &quot;void&quot;. There was nothing
        there,... Even I had lost my line of vision, and dissolved into the
        void... And felt as if everything had disappeared. Happiness. If such a
        thing called happiness exists in this world, it should be something
        which resembles the limitless nothingness. Nihility is having nothing,
        and having nothing to lose. If that isn&#x27;t &quot;happiness&quot;,
        then what is? The things reflected in my eyes have no meaning. The
        things that could not be reflected in my eyes, do not exist. There is
        nothing... in you... and... in me.

        Aging is quite similar to death. Some people stand up to aging and death
        as if it were nothing. They can do it not because they&#x27;re braver
        than others, but simply because they lack imagination. Only once people
        deny that which they love, do they become able to create it anew.
        Perhaps, the book I write, too, will die one day just like my body will.
        However, people have to accept that death is unavoidable. They will
        probably be gone in ten years. Their books will no longer exist in a
        hundred years. People accept this. Eternity is promised neither to
        humans nor to books. We live because we were born. If the system
        possesses the power of life and death over you... you&#x27;re no longer
        a human. You&#x27;re livestock. No matter how hard a rancher tries to
        pretend otherwise, they never recognize their livestock as friends.

        livestock in this boring society, have not tried at all to destroy it?
        Nothing in this world is eternal. The only thing that truly exists is
        the splendor of the souls that atone for their sins.

        In the end, I couldn&#x27;t see things from the parasites&#x27;
        perspective, never mind from Migi&#x27;s. Of course not. It wasn&#x27;t
        possible from the beginning. As two different species, we may at times
        take advantage of each other and kill each other, but it&#x27;s
        impossible to understand each other. Actually, you shouldn&#x27;t even
        think that you&#x27;ve figured out another species based on your
        standards. I think it&#x27;s human arrogance to think we understand how
        other life forms feel. There may be no other life forms that are truly a
        &quot;friend&quot; to man. Still, even if we can&#x27;t comprehend them,
        they are, without a doubt, neighbors deserving of our respect. We
        protect other species because humans themselves are lonely creatures. We
        protect the environment because humans themselves don&#x27;t want to go
        extinct. What drives us is simply self-gratification. But I think
        that&#x27;s fine, and that it&#x27;s really all there is to it.
        There&#x27;s no point in despising humans by human standards.
        That&#x27;s right. So in the end, it&#x27;s hypocritical for us to love
        Earth without loving ourselves.

        With such nice weather, I start thinking about useless things much more
        than usual. Humans are free. Although we can\xe2\x80\x99t fly through
        the skies all alone, if we can think it, we can do almost anything. We
        can sleep when we\xe2\x80\x99re sleepy. We are free to start or stop
        anything whenever we wish. Of course, it is a bit hindered by common
        sense, moralities, and the rules of society. Walking nude out in the
        streets, stealing from the elderly, and even killing, we can do all of
        this as long as we throw out our morals. Which is why they drill these
        laws in our head when we are children. And yet, people still continue to
        fight, deceive, and steal from each other. And so, people suffer because
        they live. Even now, there are events of happiness and unhappiness going
        on all over the world. \xe2\x80\xa6What can we do to make everyone
        happy? Of course that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for me to know. If the
        answer to that could be found in the shallow wisdoms of a kid, wars
        would have stopped long ago. But I also dislike just leaving that
        problem up to society or the government. After all, a great person is
        just one who follows the popular will of the people. In this world, the
        essence of a frank honest human is just an idealization. I\xe2\x80\x99m
        sure that there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing that can make everyone happy.
        Happiness is relative, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how people want it. Evil is
        also relative. Mothers can become demons when they do anything to
        protect their child. Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s usually seen as admirable. But
        when a person does anything for the country he loves, wars break out.
        Isn&#x27;t it all the same thing? No matter how much a person pretends
        to be good and kind, he will still have negative aspects. But nobody
        really tries to notice that fact. Why is that? They all try to place the
        blame on others, and never even consider the possibility that they
        themselves may have played part in the problem. Just what the heck am I
        thinking? The world isn&#x27;t going to change no matter what I think.
        Then what should I be doing? I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to do
        anything. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to order nor trouble anyone.
        That\xe2\x80\x99s just laziness, I guess. I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to
        school nor do I work and I&#x27;ve been wasting my time away since noon.
        Look at me, talking about the freedom of humans when I\xe2\x80\x99m just
        some suspicious punk in this town. In conclusion, I have nothing.

        I feel no responsibility to comrades who&#x27;ve lost lives under my

        this. But if there is something that... I can do for them. Something I
        can do for the dead... Then it is to win! I must keep winning to attain
        my dream. The same one they clung to, and risked their lives for!! To
        realize my dream, I will perch on top of their corpses.. It is a
        blood-smeared dream, after all. I don&#x27;t regret or feel guilty about
        it.. But to risk thousands of lives while never getting myself dirty.
        It&#x27;s not a dream that can be so easily realized!

        The society you all live in has long since turned into the Liar Game.
        Still, what all of you demonstrated through this game is that
        &#x27;Believing&#x27; is by no means, an easy path to follow. Sometimes,
        taking it means allowing yourself be deceived or suffering heavy damage
        you will not ever recover from. And yet, &#x27;Trust&#x27; born when you

        protect you forever. Work out or think hard and figure out a way to take
        care of things by yourself. Don&#x27;t get close to things you
        can&#x27;t take care of. Use your imagination to avoid danger. Lesson
        two: There&#x27;s more than one answer. Things can be resolved in many
        ways. On the contrary, there&#x27;s no answer in some cases. Don&#x27;t
        get hung up with one way. And finally, lesson 3: Don&#x27;t think your
        parents are always right.

        There once was a boy, who dreamed of being a hero, who sincerely
        believed in the battle to banish darkness from a world of light. But
        light and darkness are equals and where one exists, so too must the
        other. When the boy finally realized this, that was when he started the
        path to becoming a true hero.

        People can say there is a balance, a logic that everything happens for a
        reason... But the truth is far less designed. No matter how hard you
        work, when you die, you die. Some spend their entire life trying to
        scratch their way to the top, and still die in poverty. While others are
        born into wealth without ever working at all. It&#x27;s a cruel and
        random world. And yet the chaos is all so beautiful.

        live and die by their dreams. But long after they have been abandoned
        they still smolder deep in men&#x27;s hearts. Some see nothing more than
        life and death. They are dead, for they have no dreams.

        motives, there were only humble wishes that were simply natural to any
        human. Who could ever disclaim such dreams and such vows? Who could ever
        have the right to do that? However, whoever you might be, without
        choice, you have to deal with others and with the world, and have
        yourself be regulated and set down. Therefore, in the face of the
        world&#x27;s wills, your personal speculations are so ephemeral they
        can&#x27;t help being overwhelmed. Sins and punishments, destiny and
        judgment. What stands in front of Lelouch is the past he brought forth
        by himself. Is it a hatred resulting from the fact that humans are
        humans? Nonetheless, for now, we should be grateful... Yes, at least, to
        the fact that humans are the beings who look for happiness. \r\nA
        remaining piece of hope, a faint sign of wishes will be born from
        despairs.

        freedom that he decided that he was a butterfly. But when he woke up, he
        wasn&#x27;t a butterfly. He was a human after all. Then the man thought,
        &quot;I wonder if I, The Man, dreamed that I was a butterfly or if this
        moment is truly the dream. Maybe the man I am now is a dream that a
        butterfly is having.

        When going on an adventure it&#x27;s hard to stay calm. As humans, even
        if we know the adventure will be full of pain and sorrow, we still
        choose to go on it. Real adventures are not like the ones depicted in
        games or comic books - they&#x27;re neither easy nor quick and they can
        break a person&#x27;s heart. Real adventures can torment people. They
        can make you regret ever going on them. But still, that&#x27;s the true
        meaning of an adventure. If that&#x27;s so, then why do we, as people,
        choose to go on them? Why is that? Because we want to be heroes. Real
        heroes don&#x27;t give up, even in front of pain or sorrow or regret!
        Rather, they want to live a full life. That&#x27;s what real heroes are!

        Suppose that you were sitting down at a table. The napkins are in front
        of you, which napkin would you take? The one on your
        \xe2\x80\x98left\xe2\x80\x99? Or the one on your
        \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99? The one on your left side? Or the one on
        your right side? Usually you would take the one on your left side. That
        is \xe2\x80\x98correct\xe2\x80\x99 too. But in a larger sense on
        society, that is wrong. Perhaps I could even substitute
        \xe2\x80\x98society\xe2\x80\x99 with the
        \xe2\x80\x98Universe\xe2\x80\x99. The correct answer is that
        \xe2\x80\x98It is determined by the one who takes his or her own napkin
        first.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6Yes? If the first one takes the napkin to

        take the \xe2\x80\x98right\xe2\x80\x99 napkin. The same goes for the
        left. Everyone else will take the napkin to their left, because they
        have no other option. This is
        \xe2\x80\x98society\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa6 Who are the ones that
        determine the price of land first? There must have been someone who
        determined the value of money, first. The size of the rails on a train
        track? The magnitude of electricity? Laws and Regulations? Who was the
        first to determine these things? Did we all do it, because this is a
        Republic? Or was it Arbitrary? NO! The one who took the napkin first
        determined all of these things! The rules of this world are determined
        by that same principle of \xe2\x80\x98right or left?\xe2\x80\x99! In a
        Society like this table, a state of equilibrium, once one makes the
        first move, everyone must follow! In every era, this World has been
        operating by this napkin principle. And the one who \xe2\x80\x98takes
        the napkin first\xe2\x80\x99 must be someone who is respected by all.
        It\xe2\x80\x99s not that anyone can fulfill this role\xe2\x80\xa6 Those
        that are despotic or unworthy will be scorned. And those are the
        \xe2\x80\x98losers\xe2\x80\x99. In the case of this table, the

        party\xe2\x80\x99 will take the napkin first\xe2\x80\xa6 Because

        In order to obtain something, there must be something of equal value. It

        People remember their high school days as the high point of their lives.
        People say these things because everyone holds fond memories of their
        time in high school; however, I doubt that every high school student
        would want to remember their school life that way. For example, if
        neither studying, nor sports, nor socializing are of interest to
        someone, what then? What if there are students who prefer to keep a low
        profile? Though I guess that would be a pretty lonely way to live.

        Sitting there in the dark, I had the chance to think about a lot of
        things, including the nature of the world itself. And after lengthy
        consideration, I realized something; When all is said and done, this
        world is an unknowable place. On the surface, all appears rational,
        orderly. But what lies beyond that thin veneer of reason? Stability and
        reality? Or chaos and madness? What are we really made of in the end? Is
        there truly any meaning to the lives we lead? Or are we nothing more
        than hollow vessels? These are questions we can never answer, because we
        cannot hope to see beyond the world&#x27;s fragile layer of skin. So we
        live our lives filled with uncertainty, never knowing who or what we
        truly are, or what the future will bring. All we can do is imagine. Life
        becomes an unsolvable mystery with any number of twists and turns
        awaiting us. And that&#x27;s enough to fill any soul with terror.

        Three times now... We&#x27;ve fought world wars for our own nations, our
        own villages. We&#x27;ve hurt one another. We&#x27;ve hated one another.
        That hatred bred a lust for power, and that lust for power created ME. I
        was a Jinchuuriki, the embodiment of hatred and power. And I hated this
        world, and all the people in it... I wanted to destroy it with my own
        hands. The exact same thing Akatsuki is trying to do today. But one man,
        one ninja from Konoha stopped me. I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I
        hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow
        Jinchuuriki... He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will!
        There are no enemies here because we&#x27;ve all suffered at
        Akatsuki&#x27;s hand! SO THERE IS NO SAND, NO STONE, NO LEAF, NO MIST,
        NO CLOUD! THERE ARE ONLY SHINOBI! And if you still hold a grudge against
        the Sand, then when this war is over, come and take my head instead! Our
        enemies are after the friend who saved my life! If they take him, if we
        hand him over, our world is finished! I want to protect him, and I want
        to protect our world! But I&#x27;m too young to protect it all on my
        own! All of you lend me your aid!

        Territory, resources, or interests that you are determined to own.
        Ideology, religion, pride. Wars are fought over those objectives all the
        time. Meaning that when those objectives are met, the war will end.
        That, or the war will end when the human cost outweighs the gains. Anger
        and hatred are only tools to tilt a war in your favor. I&#x27;m not

        In essence, language accounts for a mere 30% of human communication. The
        other 70% is made up of information collected from eye movements and
        other body language. With that, even a loner who never takes part in
        conversation can pull off 70% of what we consider communication.

        People are like dice, a certain Frenchman said that. You throw yourself
        in the direction of your own choosing. People are free because they can
        do that. Everyone&#x27;s circumstances are different, but no matter how
        small the choice, at the very least, you can throw yourself. It&#x27;s
        not chance or fate. It&#x27;s the choice you made.

        Murder doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean evil, right? The world being what
        it is, a lot of people out there deserve to die, don&#x27;t they? But
        those who do take it upon themselves to kill others, have to be prepared
        to have others try to kill them as well. And that&#x27;s what they call
        the law of Karma, my friends. That&#x27;s why good or bad, the only ones
        who are going to be left standing are the ones with the strongest wills
        to survive.

        Children&#x27;s minds are immature. They do not possess a firm resolve
        and the strength to turn their misery to anger. Confronted with a cruel
        fate, they were not provided with the choice of having a strong will.
        Moreover, as they have not lived through and comprehended life, ideals
        such as honor and hope are yet to be completely nurtured in them.
        Therefore, in moments of despair, children are more prone than adults to
        seal away their own mind, lock up their own heart. Because they have not
        tasted the joy of life they can afford to discard. Because they have not
        understood the meaning of future, they can sink into despair.

        &quot;The important thing is to take part.&quot; Famous words spoken by
        Pierre de Fr\xc3\xa9dy, Baron de Coubertin during a speech. However,
        this quote tends to be frequently misused and serves as kind of a threat
        to force participation. There are tons of wild-goose chases in this
        world, y&#x27;know. If the most important thing is to take part, then
        surely one could find meaning in not taking part as well. And if
        everything&#x27;s worth experiencing, then there&#x27;s little doubt
        that the feeling of not experiencing something is, in itself, worth
        experiencing. In fact, you could even call it a valuable experience to
        not experience something everyone else does.

        [to Chane] Sorry about this, young lady, but not being able to verbalize
        might be a lucky break for you in a way. People can waste an awful lot
        of energy by putting sadness into words. Or maybe joy into words. And
        then of course, there&#x27;s putting anger into words. And the words can
        double when it comes to fear or pain. In that sense, being so afraid
        that you can&#x27;t find any words may save your life. Being unable to
        speak in extreme stress, in a body that is obligated to control energy
        consumption, is an act of, OH, I don&#x27;t know, maybe, self defense?

        The gods have, since ancient times, created methods to test humans. The
        system God has created... it opposes all living creatures and splits the
        world. It condemns people to roles. Heaven pretends they can&#x27;t see
        the suffering of the people. Only the lucky few find the way. The pain
        of those beings reaches deep into my heart. I want to counter this
        discrimination and extend a helping hand. In order to do that, the only
        thing that can be done is to create a new system! See... this is what
        God has wrought... I cannot allow such a system to continue! This is the
        will of my quarrel with Heaven. I would like you to come with me. If I
        had your help, even the weak-of-heart could have their wishes fulfilled.
        So that everyone can be equal and happy, I wish to reach out.

        They come here from across the world to butt heads and jostle for power.
        An evil city caught between the east and the west founded during the
        Cold War and nurtured by many who came here to ride the wave of the
        illegal drug trade sweeping across the continent. The edge of the world,
        the crucible of hypocrisy, a place where those whose souls have been
        destroyed in the relentless search for money and power reside. A final
        stop on the way to hell. How have I managed to stay alive this long?
        With the help of three people: Dutch, Revy and Benny. Also known as the
        Lagoon Company. The name of this city is spoken of among the villains of
        the world. Many who come here to make a name for themselves are
        swallowed by the darkness, never to return. A cruel fate awaits any
        half-assed small time crook, who accidentally stumbles into Roanapur.
        Right now another sacrificial lamb has wandered too far from home. The

        I don&#x27;t understand why are you so fixated on life and death? At any
        rate, your friends will soon be annihilated. So what if that&#x27;s one
        step closer? They should have seen this coming from the start. If they
        couldn&#x27;t see it coming, the fault lies in their own foolishness.
        Laughing them off as a group of idiots would be sufficient. Why
        can&#x27;t you do that? If it were me, and my friends entered Hueco
        Mundo without first gauging their strength, I&#x27;d be infuriated by
        their stupidity.

        It&#x27;s difficult to change someone&#x27;s emotions, no matter how

        still there. It&#x27;s just hiding where you can&#x27;t see it, and
        given the slightest chance, it will reassert itself. Now then, given

        In the first place, the logic that says &quot;those who play games are
        kids&quot; is itself an allusion, therefore one might say that
        shoehorning reality into your stubborn dualism is already a criticism of
        the self. In short, humans can only recognize reality through the filter
        called &quot;me&quot; and so they are unable to escape the constraints

        items like phones work. I can&#x27;t even explain why a bicycle is fast.
        When I think like this, I wonder how many things I really understand.
        Yet I can live on. Because all these mysteries have joined together to
        keep me alive. Sometimes I admire that before I go to bed.

        I thought that everyone in Japan had to be packed in there. So I turned
        to my dad and asked him,&quot;Do you know how many people are here right
        now&quot;? He said probably fifty thousand, since the stadium was full.
        I was only one little person in that big crowded stadium filled with
        people, and there were so many people there, but it was just a handful
        out of the entire population. Up till then, I always thought that I was,
        I don&#x27;t know, kind of a special person. It was fun to be with my
        family. I had fun with my classmates. And the school that I was going
        to, it had just about the most interesting people anywhere. But that
        night, I realized it wasn&#x27;t true. All the stuff we did during class
        that I thought was so fun and cool, was probably happening just like
        that in classes in other schools all over Japan. There was nothing
        special about my school at all.

        Weaklings will stay weak forever. But weakness is not evil, since human
        beings are weak creatures to begin with. Alone, you feel nothing but
        insecurity; that&#x27;s why we form guilds, that&#x27;s why we have
        friends. We walk together in order to live a strong life. The clumsy
        ones will walk into more walls than the others, and it may also take
        them longer to get there. If you believe in tomorrow and put yourself
        out there, you can naturally obtain your strength. That&#x27;s how you
        will be able to smile and live strong.

        What does a view from a high place remind you of? The impulse you feel

        view - That&#x27;s &quot;far&quot;. The scenery you see from a high
        place is magnificent. Even an ordinary landscape looks beautiful. But a
        vision that&#x27;s too large creates a boundary between you and the
        world. It&#x27;s more correct for you to recognize the large world you
        see as the world you live in rather than as the small space around you.

        People aren&#x27;t born social. Sure it comes easier to some people...
        but most people, like you, need to work at it. Some more than others.
        You&#x27;re just inexperienced. For example, as a martial artist, you
        have the strength to break the table with your fist. But you also have
        the self-control to stop your fist right before it hits the table. You
        weren&#x27;t born with that control, were you? You had to refine it.
        It&#x27;s the same as interacting with people. But training for that
        isn&#x27;t in the mountains - it has to be in town where people live.
        Mingling with people, hurting them, getting hurt by them. That&#x27;s
        how you learn about people and about yourself. If you don&#x27;t,
        you&#x27;ll never care about anyone but yourself. You may be a black
        belt fighter, but you&#x27;re still a white belt in dealing with people.
        For the sake of the girl who will one day tell you she loves you...
        Don&#x27;t turn away. Keep training.

        (referring to the letter for Kisa from the teacher) Here. It says to

        supposed to find them? I only know things I hate about myself.
        &#x27;Cause that&#x27;s all I know, I hate myself. But even if you force
        yourself to find good things... it feels so empty. It doesn&#x27;t work
        that way. People like your teacher just don&#x27;t get it. I think...
        when you hear someone say they like you, for the first time... then you
        can begin to like yourself. I think when someone accepts you, for the
        first time... you feel like you can... forgive yourself a little. You
        can begin to face your fears... with courage.

        I picked up my first gun at the age of seven. And I shot. I remember how

        piece of garbage who had the nerve to call himself my guardian. Ha. It
        was that simple. And so I was free. Yes, tomorrow would be different.

        My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days, a time of
        peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth
        Kingdom, Fire Nation, and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire
        Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, only he
        could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most,
        he vanished. A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing
        victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe
        journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation,
        leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe
        that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle
        is broken, but I haven&#x27;t lost hope. I still believe that
        somehow...the Avatar will return to save the world.

        When a person dies, he disappears, along with his past, current
        lifestyle, and his future. Many people die in missions and wars. They
        die easily and in surprisingly simple ways. Hayate was one of them.
        Those who die have goals and dreams. But everyone has something as
        important as those. Parents, siblings, friends, lovers... people who are
        important to you. They trust and help each other. The bond between the
        people important to you ever since birth and the string that binds them
        becomes thicker and stronger as time goes by... It&#x27;s beyond reason.
        Those bound to you by that string will do that because it is important.

        That may be so. What is right from wrong? What is good from evil? Nobody
        can truly distinguish between them. Even if there was a god. Now,
        supposing a god and his world existed, even then I&#x27;d stop and think
        for myself. I&#x27;d decide for myself whether his teachings are right
        or wrong. After all, I am just the same as you. I put faith in my own

        [to Szayel Aporro Grantz] Immaculate being... Was it? In this secular

        contrary. This is the reality. Common man seeks it out, they strive to
        achieve it, as if it were some tangible thing... But... The fact of the
        matter is, perfection is a hollow shell. It is devoid of any substance.
        I spit on perfection. Perfection, after all, implies you&#x27;ve reached
        the summit. No trial and error, no ability to conceptualize. An
        omniscient being would have no need for such superfluous things... Am I
        making myself clear? For people who dabble in the sciences, such as
        ourselves, perfection would make us obsolete. Many magnificent things
        have been, and will continue to come into existence... And yet every
        last one of them will fall short of perfection&#x27;s finish. Our
        function as men of science relies on their many shortcomings. Then, and
        only then, can we apply the fruits of our labor. To put it simply... As
        soon as you began spouting that nonsense about being an immaculate
        being... your fate was sealed. How dare you call yourself a man of
        science?

        them, then your heart will always live on within them. Kuchiki,
        that&#x27;s why...you must never, ever, ever die alone. Got it, Kuchiki?

        Alchemy: The science of understanding the structure of matter, breaking
        it down, then reconstructing it as something else. It can even make gold
        from lead. But alchemy is a science, so it must follow the natural laws:
        To create, something of equal value must be lost. This is the principle
        of Equivalent Exchange. But on that night, I learned the value of some
        things can&#x27;t be measured on a simple scale. My brother and I knew
        the laws of science, of Equivalent Exchange, that gain required
        sacrifice, that something had to be taken from us. But we thought there
        was nothing more we could lose. We were wrong.
